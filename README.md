# Large Thin Wrapper

* A thin OpenGL core-to-OpenGL ES wrapper, primarily intended for running Minecraft.

* To fix some issues with seus shader you can create a custom_env.txt and write LTW_SHADERCONV_CHECKNAN=1 in the txt file and paste it where you can see your latestlog.txt

# A plugin that helps you to run ltw on other pojavlauncher forks lile Zalith launcher, Fold craft launcher and PojavGlowWorm and many more


# credits to @artdeell for the upstreamed ltw libs and for fcl plugin thanks to @ShirosakiMio for the base plugin
